1. I reached out to BCS learning Assistant to get help with setting up the api URL correctly.  
2. I really struggled with getting the api working correctly with the URL.  While researching I found a few github sites that had varing solutions to the problems we were presented.  A lot of the solutions were very similar to the information and code we discussed in class.  I liked some solutions and other solutions I did not follow what they were doing, but the most helpful sites to help piece together some of the code that I used in my work were: https://github.com/mileslucey/weatherpy/blob/master/WeatherPy.ipynb, and another useful site that I really found easy to follow what they were doing and helped piece the code was https://github.com/JLeigh101/python-api-challenge/tree/main/starter_code, and finally I got some guideance from this site https://github.com/Sdailey40/WeatherPy/blob/master/WeatherPy_2.ipynb
3. Working with api's is far more difficult than importing a CSV file and making changes.
